# Infuse

`Infuse` is a lightweigth and simple `Dependency Injection` framework. 
It's actually an implementation of the `Service Locator` pattern, based on a simple concept of registering and consuming dependencies/services to avoid a strong coupling between the components.


## Why is it called Infuse?

The word `infuse` means to fill something with a particular quality or emotion. It can also mean to introduce something into something else, such as a liquid or a situation, to make it more effective or complete.
